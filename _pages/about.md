I am a PhD student at Cornell University's Astronomy department working with Dr. Anna Ho on modelling the radio emission from fast-blue-optical-transients (FBOTs) due to synchrotron emission. I seek to uncover the progenitor of FBOTs through inference of their mass-loss rate, shock velocity, magnetic field strengths, and shock radius evolution via careful modeling! During my bachelor's, I worked with Dr. Shaon Ghosh to explore methods of constraining the equation of state of neutron star matter using real/simulated grav-wave detections and/or electromagnetic observations. I obtained my B.S. in Physics with a concentration in Astronomy at Montclair State University.

I am a huge fan of sci-fi novels, shows, and movies. I take pride in writing legible & efficient scripts and love listening to audiobooks while doing so.
