`Dr. Shaon Ghosh is an astrophysicist working on detection and analysis of gravitational wave data. He is engaged in developing tools for understanding the structure of neutron stars. Neutron stars are fascinating objects, with matter inside the neutron star predicted to be denser than the matter inside the atomic nucleus. He works on extracting the deformability information from their imprint on the gravitational waves. By measuring the tidal deformability, Dr. Ghosh makes inferences on various models of the equation of state of the matter inside the neutron star.`
