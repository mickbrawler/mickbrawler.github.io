`Dr. Anna Ho's research uses telescopes located all over the world and in space to study the lives and deaths of stars and the physics of those phenomena and other energetic cosmic events.  She uses wide-field surveys along with targeted observations from gamma-ray to radio wavelengths, and works to understand the physical processes governing the observed emission. She is an active member of several international collaborations, and serves as co-chair of the gamma-ray bursts working group for the ULTRASAT mission.`
